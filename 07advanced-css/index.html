        <h2>Where he started</h2>
        <p>Daniel Caesar, born Ashton Dumar Norwill Simmonds on April 5, 1995, in Toronto, Canada, grew up in a musically inclined household in Oshawa, Ontario. His father was a gospel singer, which heavily influenced Caesar's early exposure to music. Raised in a religious environment, he often sang in church, where he developed his soulful voice and passion for music. Despite his family's initial disapproval of secular music, Caesar was drawn to R&B, soul, and alternative sounds, which later shaped his signature style. After experiencing a strained relationship with his family and brief homelessness during his teenage years, Caesar found solace in songwriting, channeling his life experiences into deeply personal music that would later captivate audiences worldwide.</p>
